In [“Talking About Abortion”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0964663916668250), Carol Sanger analyzes the discussion of abortion from verious veiwpoints, such as human rights, religious, and political, define the medical procedure and the sigma that surrounds it. One common discussion among scholars is exactly whose rights are violated and whose rights are protected by the legality of abortion. At the forefront of the debate is the argument of women’s rights versus fetal rights. Scholars such as Justin Buckley Dyer compare [the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade (1973) to the Court’s pro-slavery ruling in Dred Scott v. Stanford (1857)](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/utd/detail.action?docID=1139609), which ruled that The U.S. Constitution did not recognize black people, free nor enslaved, as citizens of the United States of America. Less than a decade after Roe v. Wade, William Voegeli noted that both sides of the abortion debate argue that the other side [“treats fetuses – or, conversely, pregnant women – in the same malicious and dehumanizing way as slaves”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406907). In his book [Life's Dominion: An Argument about Abortion, Euthanasia, and Individual Freedom](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-quarterly-of-healthcare-ethics/article/abs/lifes-dominion-an-argument-about-abortion-euthanasia-and-individual-freedom-ronald-dworkin-new-york-alfred-a-knopf-1993-273-pp/1B429E4F505ED07B28B6763F337ECF1B), Ronald Dworkin argued that women who are forced to carry an unwanted pregnacy to term due to unassessibity to safe and early abortions lose control of their bodily atonomy. Since the law takes control of the women’s body, anti-abortion laws put the shackles of slavery onto the women by forcing her body and mind to go through the stress andd risks of an unwanted child birth. A doctor’s right to practice medicine and right to not practice abortions has entered the politisized abortion discussion in recent years. Robert Post argues that abortion statutes that require doctors to inform patients that she is killing [“a whole, separate, unique, living human being”](https://www.illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2007/3/Post.pdf) and prohibit certain medical procederes for abortion infringes on a doctor’s first amendment rights and the right to practice medicine. Other Doctors such as Jody Feder argue that they have the conscientious right to not preform abortions or be involved in abortion procedures. Jody Feder also argues in her [CRS Report for Congress](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/4405/feder-2005-history.pdf?sequence=1) that medical students, doctors, and anyone else in health training programs have the conscientious right to not learn about abortion and the procedure in their classes. 

In recent years, scholars have been studying how access to abortion effect the rate at which women of different socioeconomic statuses and races get abortions. Vinita Goyal , Isabel H. McLoughlin Brooks, and Daniel A. Powers study, [Differences in abortion rates by race–ethnicity after implementation of a restrictive Texas law](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782420301116), at the University of Texas at Austin found that the abortion clinics closings due to HB2 affected hispanic women more than white women. According to the [Texas Demographic Center](https://utsa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=a014d96ac6fd4e10b3051117d92a4648), a large portion of the hispanic population in Texas live along the Texas Mexico border. [A Texas survey](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0877-0) found that women who lived near the Mexico boarder had more difficulties accessing abortion due to factors such as transportation issues, the cost of abortion, and the cost of transportation. Due to this, these women also knew more people who attempted to do at home abortions. Our map aims to enhance the scholarly discussion by looking at how the locations of abortion clinics line up with the average socioeconomic statuses of different counties in Texas and revealing the obstacles women of different socioeconomic statuses face to get abortions over the years.
