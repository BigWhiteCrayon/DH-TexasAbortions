# So Why is it So Hard to Answer?

## Jordan Youngberg

When we first started on this project, we thought we would have some long running database of abortion clinics in Texas. We may have to do some research and compiling but ultimately there would be a database somewhere. There wasn't. We could find research over [the effects of HB2](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303134), I even found sources that stated [how many abortion clinics existed in certain
years](https://books.google.com/books?id=RDqXplZptaIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA119), but they all ultimately failed to *show* the effects of these changes over time
on women across the state.

Now, it would be a lie to say we are not indebted to other
similar works. The [Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/28/texas-abortion-clinics-have-closed-hb2-passed-2013/)
published an article in 2016 on the effects of HB2 that allowed this project to
exist in the first place. Yet, we still relied on the recency of HB2; Without
Google Maps and Yellow Pages continuing to log many of these places after they
closed, it would have been impossible to extrapolate where many of these closed
clinics were. Even using the [state licensing
system](https://vo.ras.dshs.state.tx.us/datamart/mainMenu.do) we struggled to find the currently operating clinics due to obtuse design. Outside of these resources, there is shockingly little concrete information for such a devisive
topic.

While a frustrating experience, that lack of information is
also a fascinating discovery. State government regulates abortions heavily; one
would expect they had a publicly accessible list of all current and previously
operating clinics, but they don't. Their database held a few revoked or expired
licenses, but not the approximately 20 that have ceased operation since the original
passage of HB2 in 2013 and certainly not [the 128 that existed in 1982](https://books.google.com/books?id=RDqXplZptaIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA119). Evidence
suggests that many of the recent closures have [disproportionately affected minority
women and those in poverty](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2020.04.008), but there is no way to track the effects into recent
history. Even back to 2013, we had to make some approximations on certain
locations that moved or got demolished. Reproductive law divides our country and
being unable to know the effects of previous laws today means neither side can
make informed decisions.
