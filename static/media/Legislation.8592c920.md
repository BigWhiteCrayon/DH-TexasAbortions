There are many factors that can reduce a woman's ability to actually terminate a pregnancy. Here are several legislative decisions that are  counteractive to women's bodily autonomy, and whether or not Texas implements them.

38 states require an abortion to be performed by a licensed physician. 19 states require an abortion to be performed in a hospital after a specified point in the pregnancy, and 17 states require the involvement of a second physician after a specified point. Texas requires abortions to be performed by a licensed physician.
### Must be performed at a hospital at specified gestation:✘
43 states prohibit abortions after a specified point in pregnancy, with some exceptions provided. The allowable circumstances are generally when an abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health. Texas does not require abortions to be performed at a hospital at a certain point ingestation. 
### Partial birth abortions prohibited: ✓
Partial birth abortion is also called intact dilation and extraction. It is a surgical procedure that removes an intact fetus from the uterus. 21 states have laws in effect that prohibit “partial-birth”abortion. 3 of these laws apply only to post-viability abortions. Texas prohibits partial birth abortions.

### Public funding may be used for life-threatening/special cases: ✓
16 states use their own funds to pay for all or most medically necessary abortions for Medicaid enrollees in the state. 33 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the use of state funds except in those cases when federal funds are available: where the patient's life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Texas only allows public funding to be used in special/life threatening cases.
### Private insurance coverage is limited: ✓
12 states restrict coverage of abortion in private insurance plans, most often limiting coverage only to when the patient's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term. Most states allow the purchase of additional abortion coverage at an additional cost. Texas limits private insurance coverage of abortions.

45 states allow individual health care providers to refuse to participate in an abortion. 42 states allow institutions to refuse to perform abortions, 16 of which limit refusal to private or religious institutions. Texas allows refusal of abortions after 20 weeks gestation.

Texas requires mandated counseling on all three.
### Required 24 hour waiting period: ✓
25 states require a person seeking an abortion to wait a specified period of time, usually 24 hours, between when they receive counseling and the procedure is performed. 12 of these states have laws that effectively require the patient make two separate trips to the clinic to obtain the procedure.
