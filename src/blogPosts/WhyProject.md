Nearly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion within their [lifetime](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/roe-v-wade).

Surprisingly, there are high levels of support for legalized abortion in America. 77% of Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned; this is the highest level of public support for abortion rights under Roe [since the landmark decision was announced in 1973](www.prochoiceamerica.org/laws-policy/state-government/). However, despite the overall consensus on this issue, access to abortion is still severely limited.

Despite the legalization of abortion, there are still significant barriers that prevent women from actually exercising this right. Our project creates a visualization of access to abortion in order to illustrate how difficult getting an abortion can be, despite its legality. In Texas, 43% of women live in counties with no abortion clinics. The current governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, opposes reproductive freedom, and the Texas House and Senateboth oppose reproductive freedom.

The inclusion of the median household income overlay,as well as the interactive quiz, shows that socioeconomic status can greatly impact a woman'sability to get an abortion. Texas law actively prohibits abortion coverage in all or some of the private insurance market, meaning even those with medical insurance could not access coverage in order to cover the high cost of abortion. Additionally, Texas law does not guarantee expanded coverage for contraception.These factors, combined with the far distances that women would have to travel in order to even go to an abortion clinic, make seeking an abortion even more difficult for low income women.

We believe that access to abortion is one of the largestbarriers to a quality that women face in the 21st-century. The inability to terminate an unwanted pregnancy safely and affordably severely limits the bodily autonomy of women. Despite the legality of abortion under Roe v. Wade, many barriers to reproductive health care still exist today. We created this project in the hopes of educating our viewers on the reality of reproductive access today.
